### Input File Specification

Consider an input file named `input` containing a set of DROCAs (Deterministic Real-Time One-Counter Automata). Below is an explanation of its structure and meaning:

---

#### Example Content of `input`:

1                                     # Number of input DROCAs
Language_0                            # Name of Language 1
6                                     # Number of states
0                                     # Initial state
4                                     # Final state(s)
a b                                   # Alphabet
0 +1 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 5 +1            # Transitions on 'a' from counter value 0
0 +1 5 +1 3 +1 4 +1 5 +1 5 +1        # Transitions on 'a' from +ve counter value
5 +1 5 +1 3 0 4 0 5 0 5 +1           # Transitions on 'b' from counter value 0
1 -1 1 -1 3 +1 4 +1 5 +1 5 +1        # Transitions on 'b' from +ve counter value

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

#### Line 1:
Specifies the number of DROCAs described in the file.  
Example: `1` indicates the file contains one DROCA.

#### Line 2:
Provides the name of the DROCA or the associated language.  
Example: `Language_0` is the name of the DROCA.

#### Line 3:
Indicates the total number of states in the DROCA. States are labeled sequentially, starting from 0.  
Example: `6` means the states are labeled as `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

#### Line 4:
Specifies the label of the initial state.  
Example: `0` is the initial state.

#### Line 5:
Lists the final states in the DROCA.  
Example: `4` indicates state `4` is the only final state.

#### Line 6:
Lists the input alphabet as a space-separated string of symbols.  
Example: `a b` defines the input alphabet as `{a, b}`.

#### Lines 7-10:
Define the transition functions for each input symbol (`a` and `b`) from two possible counter values: `0` and positive counter value (`+ve`). The format for these lines is:

[target state0] [counter increment/decrement] [target state1] ...
Each transition is described in terms of the current state, the effect on the counter, and the target state.

### Detailed Explanation of Transitions

For transitions on a symbol (e.g., `a` or `b`), the value at index `2*i` in the transition line denotes the state to which the automaton transitions **on input symbol** from state `i`, and the value at index `2*i + 1` specifies the counter action (`+1`, `-1`, or `0`).

---

#### Example: Line 7

0 +1 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 5 +1            # Transitions on 'a' from counter value 0

Represents transitions for input `a` from a counter value of `0`:
- From state `0`, on input `a`, the automaton transitions to state `0` and increments the counter by `+1`.
- From state `1`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `2` with no change to the counter.
- From state `2`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `3` with no change to the counter.
- From state `3`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `4` with no change to the counter.
- From state `4`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `5` with no change to the counter.
- From state `5`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `5` and increments the counter by `+1`.

---

#### Example: Line 8

0 +1 5 +1 3 +1 4 +1 5 +1 5 +1        # Transitions on 'a' from +ve counter value

Represents transitions for input `a` from a positive counter value:
- From state `0`, on input `a`, the automaton transitions to state `0` and increments the counter by `+1`.
- From state `1`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `5` and increments the counter by `+1`.
- From state `2`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `3` and increments the counter by `+1`.
- From state `3`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `4` and increments the counter by `+1`.
- From state `4`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `5` and increments the counter by `+1`.
- From state `5`, on input `a`, it transitions to state `5` and increments the counter by `+1`.

#### Example: Line 9

5 +1 5 +1 3 0 4 0 5 0 5 +1           # Transitions on 'b' from counter value 0

Represents transitions for input `b` from a counter value of `0`.

---

#### Example: Line 10

1 -1 1 -1 3 +1 4 +1 5 +1 5 +1        # Transitions on 'b' from +ve counter value

Represents transitions for input `b` from a positive counter value.
